Week 2 – Automation, Orchestration & AI Synergy

A collection of AI-driven builds from Mystery2Mastery Episode 3, where automation meets orchestration and AI tools collaborate like a perfect symphony. This week, I explored how multiple AI tools can interact, trigger, and enhance each other’s outputs — building from modular experiments into a fully orchestrated AI system.

Projects Overview

Mini Project 1 – LangChain RAG PDF Q&A Bot

An interactive knowledge assistant powered by LangChain.
Upload a PDF, ask questions, and get precise answers grounded in the document.
Combines retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with vector search for accuracy.
A step toward practical, knowledge-specific AI agents.

Mini Project 2 – Make “Instant Headline Hacker”

A real-time automation pipeline for news feeds.
Make watches RSS feeds for fresh headlines.
AI automatically summarizes and formats them.
Turns a raw feed into an instant insight engine — no manual input required.

Mini Project 3 – OpenRouter “Battle of the Bots”

A head-to-head test of AI models on the same prompt.
GPT, DeepSeek & LLaMA each respond to the same question.
Their answers are displayed side-by-side to reveal differences in reasoning, tone, and creativity.
A fun way to explore the “personalities” of different LLMs.

Major Project – The AI Orchestra

A fully orchestrated AI system where tools work together in harmony:
Make detects a new request (whatsapp).
It triggers a LangChain pipeline to process the task.
LangChain routes queries to AI model via OpenRouter.
Responses are merged, refined, and formatted.
The polished answer is delivered automatically back to the requester.

The result: A hands-off, multi-model AI assistant — switching between models, keeping history, and delivering orchestrated intelligence in real time.
